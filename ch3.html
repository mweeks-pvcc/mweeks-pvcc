  <ol>
    <li> Operating System </li>
    <ul> <li> is the software that controls the overall operation of a computer </li> </ul>
    <li> Job Queue</li>
    <ul> <li> is a storage organization in which objects(in this case,jobs) are ordered in FIFO</li> </ul>
    <li> FIFO</li>
    <ul> <li> First In, First Out</li> </ul>
    <li> Interactive Processing</li>
    <ul> <li> allowing a program to be executed to carry dialog with the user through remote terminals </li> </ul>
    <li> Time-Sharing</li>
    <ul> <li>operating systems that provided service to multiple users at the same time  </li> </ul>
    <li> Multipleprogramming</li>
    <ul> <li> Time-Sharing in which time is divided into intervals and then the execution of each job is restricted to only one interval at a time   </li> </ul>
    <li> Application Software</li>
    <ul> <li> consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization </li> </ul>
    <li> System Software</li>
    <ul> <li> is divided into two categories, one is the operating system itself, and the other consists of software units collectively known as Utility Software </li> </ul>
    <li> Utility Software</li>
    <ul> <li> programs for preforming activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system </li> </ul>
    <li> Graphical user interface
    <ul> <li> system in which objects are manipulated such as files, and programs are represented pictorally on the display as icons</li> </ul>
    <li> (GUI)</li>
    <ul> <li> short for Graphics User Interface</li> </ul>
    <li> Shell </li>
    <ul> <li> older user interface, that commmunicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen </li> </ul>
    <li> Kernel </li>
    <ul> <li> the internal part of an operating system, consists of software programs that preform basic functions required by the computer installation </li> </ul>
    <li> Device Driver </li>
    <ul> <li> are the software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times,directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attatched to the machine </li> </ul>
    <li> File Manager</li>
    <ul> <li> software componet whose job is to coordinate the use of the machine's mass storage facilities </li> </ul>
    </li> Virtual Memory </li>
    <ul> <li> the product of the memory manager shuffeling pages back and fourth between main memory and mass storage, so that the pages that are needed are actualy present in the 4GB of main memory, this "fictional" memory space </li> </ul>
    <li> Boot Strapping</li>
    <ul> <li> is preformed each time a computer is turned on, procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage(where it is permanetly stored) into main memory(which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on) </li> </ul>
    <li> Rom</li>
    <ul> <li> read-only memory, memory that can be read but can not be altered, special nonvolatile cells constructed from a small portion of the main memory</li> </ul>
    <li> Deadlock</li>
    <ul> <li> the condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to the other</li> </ul>
    <li> Spooling </li>
    <ul> <li> technique of holding data for output at a later but more convienient time</li> </ul>
    <li> Super User or Administrator</li>
    <ul> <li> has highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him-or herself as the Administrator ( usually by name and password) during the login procedure, can alter settings within the operating system, modify critical software packages, adjust the privileges granted to other users, and preform a variety of other maintenance activities that are denied normal users</li> </ul>
    <li> Multi-factor authentication</li>
    <ul> <li> multiple factors used to grant authentication, such as passwords, biometrics, special access code, none are entirely fool proof</li> </ul>
